Agentic Ethereum Hackathon India
🛠 Project Title – Tech Misai
Welcome to our submission for the Agentic Ethereum Hackathon by Reskilll & Geodework! This repository includes our project code, documentation, and related assets.

📌 Problem Statement
We addressed the challenge: “Decentralized Identity and Verification in Healthcare”
Healthcare providers — including hospitals, insurers, and clinics — suffer from slow manual workflows, data silos, and weak identity checks. Patients are forced to repeatedly share sensitive information, increasing both risk and friction. These inefficiencies block interoperability, raise costs, and enable fraud — all of which hurt patient trust and access to care.

💡 Our Solution
Project Name: Misai Care
Misai Care is a privacy-preserving decentralized identity solution built for healthcare providers and insurers. It leverages verifiable credentials, blockchain, and LLM-powered interfaces to streamline patient onboarding, reduce oversharing, and enhance trust between stakeholders. With on-chain logic and off-chain AI, Misai Care ensures secure, fast, and interoperable identity verification.
